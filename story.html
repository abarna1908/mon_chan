                    <p>Our relationship started as a long-kept secret from our closest friends. Then it evolved into a more healthy and strong one. I love her. She is so passionate and not easy going and That's good. And when she gets upset, I am good at making her feel better. So people might say she is high maintenance, but its okay, because I like... maintaining her. </p>

                    <p>The proposal was a supposed to be a surprise to monica planned by me. Then I was surprised by her. I said "you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if youâ€™ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way." Then I finally asked, "Monica, will you marry me?"

                    <p>Jan 15, 2017</p>
                    <p>Oh yeah.. She said "yes". I've to tell this, I was always thought that commitment was the most difficult thing I ever had to do but then when I see her, I realised how simple it was. Any surprises that comes in our way, its ok, because we love each other and we are meant to be with each other. So, I guess, you reached the end of the story.</p>
